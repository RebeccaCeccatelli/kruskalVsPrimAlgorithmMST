The aim of this project is comparing the two main computing algorithms of a Minimum Spanning Tree on non-oriented connected graphs.
These are the Kruskal's Algorithm and the Prim's Algorithm.
This project is written in Python.

 For those who understand Italian, there's a detailed report of this research ("Relazione3.pdf"). There are also some interesting plots and class diagrams in it.
